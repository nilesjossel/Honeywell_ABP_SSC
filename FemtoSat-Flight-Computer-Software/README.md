# FemtoSat-Flight-Computer-Software

## About
The FemtoSat project is a testbed designed to validate a novel capsule-to-capsule communications scheme designed for the third iteration of the Kentucky Re-Entry Probe Experiment (KREPE3).

The FemtoSats are scaled down versions of the Kentucky Re-entry Universal Payload System (KRUPS) capsules.  They consist of the following:
* A raspberry pi pico 2W (rp2350) acting as the flight computer
* A LoRa modem (LR62XE) for long range intercapsule communications
* A temperature/pressure/humidity sensor (BME280)
* A 9-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (BNO086)
